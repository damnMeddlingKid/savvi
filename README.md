# Savvi (work in progress)

Savvi is a light weight app to jot down ideas and poll people's thoughts on ideas you have. An idea can be anything from and "Uber for Cats" to your plans for world domination.

## Technology

Savvi uses the following technologies

Backend:
* Python/Django web framework
* Postgresql database
* Gunicorn

Frontend:
* Java/Android
  
## Motivation

Just a fun side project to learn Django and Android mobile application development.

## Installation

Its a bit hairy right now, will be trying to bake the backend into a Docker image soon.
